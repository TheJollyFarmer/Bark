## Notes / Observations
* I was not sure how you intended to style the Nav. How I would go about designing a commercial project would depend upon the layout of the rest of the page.
    * Is the design we see going to fill the whole page?
    * Would there be additional content?
* My layout would probably be a little different if I had the exact specifications or the freedom to choose the design in its entirety.
    * This did lead me to imitate your template too closely, resulting in some CSS I would not use under the circumstances described above.
* I used web components. I am not sure if this is what you intended.
* I am not sure if this was your intention; however, I filled the cart out with the provided example to illustrate the functionality of the scroll in the cart menu.
